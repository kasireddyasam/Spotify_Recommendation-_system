# Spotify_Recommendation-_system
# 🎵 Music Recommendation System 🎶

## 🚀 Overview
This project implements a music recommendation system using Python and machine learning techniques. The system analyzes song metadata and lyrics to recommend top songs based on user preferences, including mood, artist, or song name.

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### 📝 Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Utilized NLP techniques to analyze song lyrics and extract meaningful features for mood analysis.
- Implemented tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization to preprocess the text data and prepare it for analysis.

### 😊 Sentiment Analysis
- Applied sentiment analysis to classify songs by mood, enabling personalized recommendations.
- Leveraged sentiment scores to quantify the emotional content of song lyrics, distinguishing between happy, sad, and other moods.

### 📝 TF-IDF Model
- Utilized the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) model to represent song lyrics as numerical vectors.
- Calculated the TF-IDF weights for each word in the lyrics to create feature vectors for machine learning analysis.


### 🤖 Machine Learning
- Used machine learning algorithms to build a recommendation system that learns from user preferences.
- Employed techniques such as vector representation of text data and cosine similarity to compute song recommendations based on user input.

## 🏁 Getting Started
